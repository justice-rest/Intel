# RIDER TO TERMS OF SERVICE

**Date:** [Insert Date]
**Between:** [Your Organization Name] ("Customer") and GetRomy Inc. ("Provider")

This Rider ("Rider") modifies and supplements the Terms of Service (the "Agreement") governing the use of the Rōmy application and services. In the event of a conflict between the Agreement and this Rider, the terms of this Rider shall control.

### 1. DATA OWNERSHIP AND RESTRICTED USE
**Replaces or Supersedes any conflicting "License" or "Data Use" clauses:**
Customer retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Customer Data (including but not limited to donor lists, contact information, and website visitor logs). Customer grants Provider a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Customer Data **solely as necessary to provide the Services to Customer.** Provider shall not sell, rent, lease, or otherwise disclose Customer Data to any third party for such third party's own business purposes, nor shall Provider incorporate Customer Data into any public or shared dataset that is accessible by other customers of Provider.

### 2. MUTUAL INDEMNIFICATION
**Replaces or Supersedes any conflicting "Indemnity" clauses:**
a. **Provider Indemnity:** Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold Customer harmless against any third-party claim, suit, or proceeding alleging that: (i) the Service infringes any patent, copyright, or trademark; or (ii) the Service’s tracking technology (including pixels, scripts, or cookies), when installed and used as instructed, violates any applicable privacy law, regulation, or third-party privacy right.
b. **Customer Indemnity:** Customer shall indemnify Provider against claims arising solely from the Customer’s own content or unauthorized use of the Service.

### 3. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
**Replaces or Supersedes any conflicting "Limitation of Liability" clauses:**
In no event shall either party’s aggregate liability arising out of or related to this Agreement exceed the **total amount paid by Customer hereunder in the twelve (12) months preceding the last event giving rise to liability.** The foregoing limitation shall not apply to: (i) either party’s indemnification obligations under Section 2 of this Rider; (ii) liability resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) liability resulting from a breach of data security obligations involving Personal Data.

### 4. DATA PORTABILITY AND RETRIEVAL
**Adds to "Termination" Section:**
Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, Provider shall make available to Customer a downloadable file of the Customer Data (including all enriched fields, insights, and appended data generated during the term) in a standard, commercially usable format (e.g., .CSV or .JSON) for a period of at least thirty (30) days.

### 5. FCRA COMPLIANCE
**Clarification Clause:**
The parties acknowledge that Provider is not a "consumer reporting agency" as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.) ("FCRA"). Customer agrees not to use any data provided by the Service for the purpose of determining any individual's eligibility for credit, insurance, employment, housing, or any other purpose that would require FCRA compliance.
