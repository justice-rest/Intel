## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Brett M. Kingston is a serial entrepreneur and real estate developer based in Orlando, Florida, best known as founder, President, and CEO of Max King Realty LLC, a leading developer of industrial, commercial, warehouse, and flex-space properties in Central Florida. He previously founded Super Vision International (now Revolution Lighting Technologies, NASDAQ: RVLT), a fiber optic and LED lighting firm that served major clients like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Universal Studios, and Disney, earning multiple growth awards during his tenure. Kingston holds 12 U.S. patents in fiber optic technology and has been recognized as Orange County Technology Entrepreneur of the Year by Citibank/Ernst & Young, among other honors. His primary wealth sources are business ownership in real estate development and past tech exits, with an estimated net worth exceeding $10M driven by controlling stakes in mid-market real estate firms and property equity.

Philanthropic patterns show strong affinity for Jewish and Israel-related causes (e.g., donations to IDF bases, Chabad of Southwest Orlando, Lion of Judah School), alongside support for military/veterans (U.S. Navy SEAL Legacy Foundation, where he serves as Co-Chairman of the annual 9-11 event), children's charities (Give Kids the World), and local Orlando causes (Boy Scouts, law enforcement). No specific gift amounts or private foundations were identified, but corporate sponsorships via Max King Realty indicate consistent mid-five-figure+ annual giving. No political contributions or recent SEC-reported stock holdings found.

For ILAD, a NY-based mutual/membership benefit organization with a $5-10M budget and 5-10K donors, Kingston qualifies as a Principal Gift Prospect (capacity $100K-$999K single gift). His Israel/Jewish philanthropy aligns strongly with potential ILAD mission elements; prioritize cultivation via shared networks like Chabad or FIDF peers. RōmyScore™ of 24/30 signals High Priority—initiate discovery within 60 days targeting a $250K campaign pledge.

## 8. CONNECTION POINTS & AFFINITY ANALYSIS

### Mission Alignment
- **Strong Alignment:** Heavy Jewish/Israel focus (Chabad, Lion of Judah School, IDF donations) matches ILAD's mutual/membership benefit sector if faith/community-based.
- **Potential Interest Areas:** Veterans/military support could tie to ILAD programs; Orlando Jewish networks.
- **Concern Areas:** None identified; primary commitments appear local/Israel-focused.

### Existing Relationships
- **Direct Connections:** None to ILAD.
- **Peer Connections:** Chabad/FIDF donors; Orlando Jewish community (Lion of Judah).
- **Geographic Ties:** Orlando resident; NY roots (Brooklyn/Long Beach).

### Engagement Opportunities
- Navy SEAL 9-11 Event (September; sponsor/intro via co-chair role).
- Israel-focused events via FIDF/Chabad peers.
- Timing: Post-liquidity from RE deals.

---

## 9. CULTIVATION STRATEGY & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Recommended Approach
Leverage Jewish/Israel affinity for ILAD; position as peer-to-peer via NY/FL networks. With $5-10M budget, target campaign upgrade from annual supporter.

**Phase 1: Discovery (Months 1-2)**
- Research ILAD mutuals for Chabad/FIDF overlaps - Solomon Shalom Lijo - Jan 2026
- Soft intro via LinkedIn/email referencing Lion of Judah/IDF - Solomon - Dec 2025

**Phase 2: Cultivation (Months 3-4)**
- Invite to ILAD event/webinar on Israel/community benefits - Board member - Feb-Mar 2026
- Tour Max King properties; discuss shared values - Solomon - Mar 2026

**Phase 3: Solicitation (Month 5-6)**
- In-person ask at Orlando Jewish event - Solomon/Board peer - May 2026

### Ask Recommendation
- **Ask Amount:** $250K
- **Ask Type:** 3-year pledge
- **Designation:** Israel/community programs
- **Solicitor:** Solomon Shalom Lijo (personal affinity) with FIDF peer
- **Timing:** Q2 2026 (post-tax season)
- **Backup Position:** $100K annual if declined

### Talking Points
1. "Your IDF and Chabad support shows passion for Jewish/Israel causes—ILAD advances similar mutual benefits."
2. "Orlando peers like [local ILAD donor] have stepped up; your leadership fits."
3. "$250K sustains programs for 500+ families annually."

### Red Flags / Considerations
- Family dynamics (children involved); time military events.
- Avoid: Heavy RE pitch; confirm no competing Israel asks.
