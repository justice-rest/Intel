Developer: # Migration Plan for Research and Deep Research Assistant Models

Before proceeding, remember: all these changes need to be production-ready, enterprise-grade, carefully implemented and non-breaking, battle-ready

- **Replace Models:**
  - Update 'Reasoning Pro' from Perplexity Sonar to Gemini 3 Flash ([link](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-3-flash-preview)).
  - Update 'Deep Research' from Perplexity Sonar to Gemini 3 Pro ([link](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-3-pro-preview)).
  - Just like Perplexity, both of these models do support native web search - so use that

- **Tool Calling Architecture:**
  - Previously, Perplexity didn't support tool calling, so we used GPT 5 Nano as an intermediary for fetching and relaying tool outputs (CRMs, Memory, RAG, etc.) to Perplexity.
  - Since Gemini supports direct tool calling, remove GPT 5 Nano from the architecture. Have Gemini access and use tools directly.
  - After each architectural change, validate that Gemini successfully executes tool calls end-to-end and self-correct configurations if any failures occur.

- **Context Window & UX Improvements:**
  - Many optimizations were in place to avoid surpassing Perplexity's small context window limit, which led to poor user experience.
  - With Gemini's larger context window, remove these legacy optimizations and confirm that UX is improved without memory issues.

- **Reasoning Features:**
  - Ensure 'reasoning' is enabled for both 'Research' (Gemini 3 Flash) and 'Deep Research' (Gemini 3 Pro) flows.
  
- **Prompts**
  - I want the report generated by the AI to follow this exact same format:
  
```
- Executive Summary​
- Personal Background and Contact Information​
- Professional Background
  - Donor/Prospect – Comprehensive Career Profile​
  - Spouse – Comprehensive Background​

- **PDF**
  - The PDF design isn't looking beautiful, feels broken. I want you to re-design it to be much more cleaner. I really like the design of a perplexity report, I will tag it in the chat - see if you can recreate that, this is crucial. 
  
**Options**
- When I right click a chat, it shows three options: Pin, Rename, & Delete. Add one more option - Add to Project, so that, when users click it, they will be prompted to add it to newly created or existing project. 

**Email Template**

- When a user signs up, I want certain emails to be sent

Email 1 (Welcome): Sent immediately after signup. Sets expectations, explains what Rōmy does today vs. what's coming, and invites exploration without friction. Opens with the same "You're joining us early" honesty that works so well in the Alleo email.

Email 2 (How It Works): Sent 2-3 days later. Uses a concrete nonprofit example (the $15K+ gift discovery story) to show real value. Builds credibility with specific results while being honest about variability. Includes the sample screening CTA.

Email 3 (Common Challenges): Sent 4-5 days later. Addresses the biggest mindset shift—that most nonprofits do prospect research backwards. This creates a framework for why Rōmy matters beyond just saving time.

Email 4 (Moving Forward): Sent 6-7 days later. Shifts from education to engagement. Asks for feedback explicitly, gives multiple pathways forward (self-serve or conversation), and hints at community-building features (office hours).

Key features that mirror Alleo's approach:

Founder voice and personal P.S. commitment

Honest about limitations upfront

Specific, concrete examples instead of feature lists

Multiple invitations to engage at different comfort levels

Clear CTAs that don't require immediate commitment

Fast-follow content (2-7 day sequence keeps momentum)

Here's exactly how I want the emails to be:

```
Rōmy Onboarding Email Sequence
Email 1: Welcome (Send within seconds of signup)
Subject: Welcome to Rōmy – Let me explain what you're getting into

Hi [First Name],

Welcome to Rōmy. I'm [Your Name], the founder.

I want to be upfront with you: You're joining us early.

Rōmy is an AI-powered donor screening and wealth identification tool built specifically for small and mid-sized nonprofits. We're not another generic donor database. We connect to your existing CRM and help you identify who in your network has capacity to give—so you can focus your fundraising efforts where they actually matter.

But here's what I'm being honest about:

What Rōmy can do for you today:

Analyze your donor database and flag high-capacity prospects you might be missing

Research giving capacity and philanthropic interests for your top prospects

Suggest the right wealth indicators and screening criteria for your organization

Help you build better prospect lists without spending weeks on research

Create actionable intelligence from public giving records and wealth data

What we're still building:

Advanced predictive modeling (coming in Q1)

Deeper integration with all major CRM platforms (we support the big ones now)

Custom wealth screening rules specific to your mission area (in progress)

I'm not going to tell you we're perfect. We're a small team working directly with nonprofit leaders like you, and your feedback will shape every major feature we add.

Your next step: Log in and explore the app. You don't need to connect your CRM yet—start by running a sample screening to see how it works. No credit card required. No pressure.

When you're ready to see the real power (analyzing your actual donor database), you can connect your Salesforce, DonorPerfect, or other CRM from Settings → Integrations. We'll walk you through it.

I'll send you a specific example in a few days showing exactly how one nonprofit used Rōmy to identify a $50K+ prospect they almost missed.

Until then, if you have any questions—or if something doesn't work—hit reply. I read every email and respond within a few hours.

— [Your Name]

P.S. If you're in the Fort Worth/Dallas area and want to chat over coffee, let me know. I'm always happy to talk through your fundraising challenges in person.

Email 2: How It Works (Day 2-3)
Subject: Here's exactly how Rōmy works (and why it's different)

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for signing up. I wanted to give you a real example of how Rōmy actually saves nonprofits time.

Let's say you have 500 donors in your database. Your development team spends roughly 30-40 hours per quarter researching wealth capacity for major gift prospects. You're using LinkedIn, Google, Guidestar, WealthEngine, or some combination of tools. It's fragmented. It's slow. You miss people.

Here's what happens with Rōmy:

You upload your donor list (or connect your CRM directly)

Rōmy analyzes giving history, capacity indicators, and public wealth data

Within minutes, you get a prioritized prospect list with wealth scores and giving indicators

You can then drill into individual prospects to see exactly WHY we flagged them

One nonprofit we worked with—a mid-sized education nonprofit in Texas with 1,200 donors—used Rōmy to identify 23 high-capacity prospects they'd never properly researched. They were focused on their known major donors and missed some significant capacity in their broader network.

Result? They closed two gifts of $15K+ from prospects Rōmy surfaced. That paid for a year of Rōmy in one quarter.

I don't expect every nonprofit to have that exact result. But the time savings are immediate, and the intelligence gap it closes is real.

If you want to try a sample screening with dummy data to see this in action, log into your dashboard and click "Run Sample Screening" in the upper right. It takes 60 seconds and shows you exactly how the analysis works.

Questions? Reply to this email.

Email 3: Common Challenges (Day 4-5)
Subject: The biggest mistake I see nonprofits make with prospect research

Hi [First Name],

I want to share something I've learned from talking with dozens of nonprofit fundraisers.

Most organizations do prospect research backwards.

They pick their favorite donors—the ones they know personally—and say "let's upgrade those relationships." That's not wrong, exactly. But it leaves huge capacity on the table.

Here's what actually works:

Systematic screening first. Figure out who actually has capacity across your entire database. Then layer in relationship strength and mission alignment. Then prioritize.

Most nonprofits don't do this because the work is tedious. You need to manually research dozens of prospects, cross-reference multiple data sources, and keep detailed notes. It's exactly the kind of work that should be automated.

That's why Rōmy exists.

One development director told me: "Before Rōmy, I was spending 80% of my time researching and only 20% actually building relationships. Now it's reversed."

That's the shift we're trying to make possible for nonprofits like yours.

If you haven't already: Try that sample screening I mentioned in my last email. It takes a minute and shows you exactly what I'm talking about.

And if you want to connect your actual CRM and run a real screening—no pressure, no sales pitch—I can help walk you through it. Just let me know.

Email 4: Moving Forward (Day 6-7)
Subject: What's next + one question for you

Hi [First Name],

You've had Rōmy for about a week now. I wanted to check in and ask for your help.

Here's what we'd love to know:

If you were to use Rōmy for the next 90 days, what would success look like for your organization?

More qualified major gift conversations?

A more efficient prospect research process?

Better data hygiene and donor intelligence?

Something else entirely?

This question matters because we're building features based on real nonprofit needs, and your answer helps us prioritize.

In the meantime, here's what I'd encourage you to do:

If you haven't already, run that sample screening (takes 60 seconds)

If you're ready, connect your CRM and run a real analysis of your donor database

Pick your top 5-10 prospects that Rōmy flags as high-capacity

See if the recommendations actually align with what you know about these people

Tell us if we nailed it or if we got it wrong

Honest feedback—good or bad—helps us build something your team will actually want to use.

We're also planning live office hours next month if you want to join other nonprofit leaders using Rōmy and ask questions in real time. I'll send you details if that sounds interesting.

Questions? Want to schedule a 15-minute call to talk about your specific fundraising challenges? Just reply to this email or book time here: [your calendar link]

Thanks for being an early adopter. It means a lot.

- **Batch Research:**
  - Use Gemini 3 Flash for all batch research operations.
  - Currently, batch research only processes the first 100 rows even on Scale plan (which allows 1,000). Update implementation to process up to 1,000 rows as permitted and verify the correct number is processed post-change.
  - Batch research does't feel optimized enough, because one of our advisors have stated:  "Question-- why did Romy say that the ask should be so low for someone with $15M net worth? If you ran me through the same screen what would it say for me? Is this for annual fund giving or capital campaign gifts-- we should have two columns."

  The point is that we should optimize the prompts in a much better light. 

**Experimental**
  - This is more of a experiment - can we use multiple agents? For example, Claude Code spins up multiple agents for specific tasks - would this be possible, and if so, how would you go about it + will it be production-ready, enterprise-grade?
