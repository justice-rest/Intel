As you can analyze and tell, this app has a feature to upload files in the chat (But! For now, have disabled it)

I want to at minimum, be able to upload a list of a 100 names, addresses and other such details and have the AI give me a extensive, detailed report - like how it already does for one individual (Refer SYSTEM_PROMPT)

I need you to see the limits om LinkUp, OpenRouter, Grok and see what you can do to build this out. 

REMEMBER: before proceeding w/ any plans or changes, always analyze and understand the codebase. Do not bring forth any breaking changes. Make sure all changes are production-ready, non-breaking and do not cause visual, functional or performance bugs. No existing or upcoming feature should be broken, it has to be production-ready.

I want you to think like a senior software engineer, to build enterprise-built, production-ready, non-breaking and performant code.
